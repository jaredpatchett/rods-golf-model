"""
Rod's Golf Model -- OddsPapi discovery script
==============================================
Path C, step 1: OddsPapi (oddspapi.io) claims coverage of PrizePicks odds
alongside 300+ other bookmakers, including player props. This script does
NOT assume anything about golf's sportId, market IDs, or PrizePicks' exact
bookmaker key in their system -- every one of those needs to be confirmed
live before any of it gets wired into rods_pipeline.py. Same discipline as
discover_round_shape.py: guessing field shapes has broken this app before --
the matchup dedup bug, the EV%/Edge% swap, the wind double-count -- all three
came from trusting an assumed shape instead of a confirmed one.

What this script does, in order:
  1. GET /v4/sports              -> find golf's sportId
  2. GET /v4/bookmakers          -> confirm "prizepicks" is a real bookmaker
                                     key in this system (not guessed)
  3. GET /v4/tournaments         -> find this week's PGA Tour event's
                                     tournamentId
  4. GET /v4/markets             -> see every real golf market OddsPapi has
                                     -- this is where "Total Birdies",
                                     "Round Score O/U", "2-Ball Matchup" etc
                                     either show up under real names/IDs, or
                                     don't exist at all
  5. GET /v4/odds-by-tournaments -> pull real PrizePicks-tagged odds for that
                                     tournament and print the raw shape

Run this (locally or via the matching discover-oddspapi.yml workflow), paste
the full output back, and the real pipeline/engine integration gets built
against what's actually there -- not against a guess.
